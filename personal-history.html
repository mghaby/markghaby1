      <p class="home-txt">My name is Mark Ghaby and I am working towards becoming a full stack developer. Ever since I was a child I have always been interested in technology and admired the artistic nature of coding. As a child and early teen I would constantly be trying to make different pieces of hardware under the guidance of my parents and the influence of things I would see online. As I grew older my love for technology evolved and I grew an appreciation for software rather than hardware. I would attempt to self-teach coding, specifically C++ but would never succeed. In my lifespan I have seen countless pieces of technology completely evolve and grow more intelligent by the day which is absolutely fascinating. I constantly look forward to learning about technology and its ever evolving nature in our day and age. Alternatively personal health is also a passion of mine as the way you can manipulate and provide resistance through certain exercises to completely change ones as well as the countless health benefits is fascinating.</p>
